# emailhandlegen

This is a simple Python GUI application that generates email handles based on user input. The handle is constructed using the following pattern:


[first three letters of first name][two-digit day][month][first three letters of last name]

For example, if the input is:

* First Name: John

* Day: 5

* Month: 3

* Last Name: Doe

The resulting email handle will be: joh0503doe.
